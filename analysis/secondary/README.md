# Secondary analysis

Secondary analysis includes statistical and taxonomic analyses on trimmed reads from primary analysis. Biom file and metadata csv used as input for phyloseq analysis are available for download. 

Each step is outlined [here](https://github.com/MaGIC-Analytics/Colgate_ONT_16S_analysis/blob/main/docs/ONT_16S_workflow_and_results.nb.html). 

Results include:
- Alpha diversity statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Pairwise Wilcoxon)
- Alpha diversity plots (Observed Richness, Shannon diversity, Simpson Index)
- Beta diversit statistical tests (PERMANOVA, Pairwise Adonis)
- Beta diversity plots (PCoA, NMDS)
- DeSEq2 results (including volcano plot)
- Relative abundance taxaplots at the Phylum, Genus, and Species level
